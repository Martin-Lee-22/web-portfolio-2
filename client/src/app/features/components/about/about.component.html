        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Martin Lee</p>
        <p>For the past decade I have been been working in the medical industry as a Lab Technician Assistant.</p>
        <p>However in 2020, I decided to embark on a career change and enrolled at <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/" target="_blank">BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program</a>. From there I discovered my passion and talent for web development.</p>
        <p>For the past 2 years after graduating I have been working on personal projects to improve my skills and experience new languages and frameworks</p>
        <p>I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to potential opportunities with you, your organization, and your team.</p>
